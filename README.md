# Disaster-Management
Machine Learning Model
The work in the notebook file is based on pulic data gotten from https://public.emdat.be/ for natural disasters
Data specifically from Africa was taken, and I also specifically targeted drought data
The aim of the project iis to build a Machine learning model that analyzes the severity of a disaster, and predicts if a state of emergency should be declared by the country or not
I beleive such a prediction would help governments and weather agencies manage disasters better, and get the help they need to their people as quickly as possible. Knowing if a state of emergency would be declared or not, could also help get needed foreign assistace as quickly as possible
Data Visualizations have also been done as seen in the notebooks
